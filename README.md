# Dungeon Master's Storefront

Dungeon Master's Storefront is a webapp meant for Dungeons & Dragons players to save time on shopping for equipment and items for their characters. The Dungeon Master of the group will create and stock a store with custom weapons, armor, and other equipment. Once they share their store with the players, players are able to choose a character from their roster, determine the gold available in that character's wallet, and use that gold to pay for items in the Dungeon Master's store.
